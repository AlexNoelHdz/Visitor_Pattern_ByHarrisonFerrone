Our goal with visitor pattern is calculate the discounts and number of items sold 
without adding any logic to the existing class hierarchy.

Whenever a visitable element accepts a visitor, 
the corresponding visit method is called from the concrete visitor class.

one advantaje of this code is that you can have as many different concret classes as you want.
